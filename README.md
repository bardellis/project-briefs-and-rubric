# Project Title: WhatsApp Group Analysis
## Introduction
The primary objective of this project is to gain insights into the activities and interactions within a WhatsApp group. The analysis focuses on understanding the sentiment of conversations through sentiment polarity analysis and identifying the prevalent topics discussed within the group.

## Project Overview
### Data Collection
The WhatsApp group chat data used for this analysis was collected throughout the year 2023. The group consisted of 25 members and served as a platform for course-related updates, idea exchange, and casual conversations. The data was exported using WhatsApp's built-in export feature, generating a .txt file for further processing.

### Data Cleaning
In the process of preparing the data, attention was given to addressing inconsistencies in language and potential typos within the chat messages. This step is crucial to ensure the reliability and accuracy of subsequent natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

### Feature Engineering
To enhance the analysis, feature engineering techniques were employed. This involves transforming raw data into a format that is more suitable for modeling. In the context of this project, feature engineering may include the extraction of relevant information, such as user-specific metrics or message characteristics.

### Data Exploration
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to delve into the characteristics of the dataset. This phase involves statistical and visual techniques to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data. The insights gained during EDA provide a foundation for more advanced analyses.

### Sentiment Polarity Analysis
Sentiment polarity analysis was performed to assess the emotional tone of the conversations. Positive, negative, or neutral sentiments were assigned to each message, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the overall mood within the group.

### Topic Analysis
The analysis also includes an exploration of the predominant topics discussed within the group. Topic modeling techniques, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) or Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), may have been employed to identify and categorize key themes.

## Conclusions
The project concludes with a summary of findings, highlighting key insights derived from the analysis. These insights may include patterns in sentiment over time, notable topics of discussion, and any unexpected discoveries. The conclusions drawn from the analysis contribute to a better understanding of group dynamics and communication patterns within the WhatsApp group.

## Tools Used
The entire analysis process was conducted using Python. Relevant libraries and frameworks for natural language processing, data cleaning, and exploratory data analysis were utilized to ensure a robust and efficient analysis pipeline.
